                <h3> Proper Breathing Technique</h3>
                <ul >
                    <li>Step 1: Start by standing in shallow water or holding onto the pool edge.</li>
                    <li>Step 2: Take a deep breath and submerge your face into the water.</li>
                    <li>Step 3: Exhale gently underwater through your nose. Practice slowly exhaling in bubbles.</li>
                    <li>Step 4: Raise your head to the side to inhale quickly, ensuring you’re not holding your breath underwater.</li>
                    <li>Step 5: Repeat and get comfortable with this rhythm, practicing in different positions like floating or kicking.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Floating and Buoyancy</h3>
                <ul >
                    <li>Step 1: Start by holding onto the poolside with your hands and let your body float freely in the water.</li>
                    <li>Step 2: Keep your body horizontal and try to keep your head above water with your face looking straight up.</li>
                    <li>Step 3: Relax your body and ensure your head is aligned with your spine, avoid arching your back.</li>
                    <li>Step 4: Gradually practice floating without holding onto the side, using gentle arm movements if necessary for stability.</li>
                </ul>
                <iframe class="video" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Xg6r3QcHjCk?si=FkACFxFF-hqca76v" title="YouTube video player"

                <h3>Basic Arm Movements (Freestyle & Backstroke)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Step 1: For freestyle, extend one arm in front while the other arm is by your side.</li>
                    <li>Step 2: Pull the extended arm down along your side and back, keeping a relaxed but firm motion.</li>
                    <li>Step 3: Rotate your body slightly with each stroke and switch arms as one arm pushes through the water.</li>
                    <li>Step 4: For backstroke, keep your arms alternating overhead with a smooth, continuous motion while kicking gently.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Streamlined Body Position</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Step 1: Keep your body horizontal and streamlined in the water. Avoid lifting your head too high.</li>
                    <li>Step 2: Engage your core muscles to maintain a flat and straight position.</li>
                    <li>Step 3: When swimming freestyle, maintain your head in a neutral position, facing down. This minimizes drag.</li>
                    <li>Step 4: Focus on keeping your body aligned throughout the stroke to reduce resistance in the water.</li>
                </ul>
                <iframe class="video" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ij0QS8R-F8s?si=S2QynbvqymI5sOBC" title="YouTube video player"

                <h3>Efficient Kicking</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Step 1: Practice flutter kicking by keeping your legs straight with a slight bend at the knee.</li>
                    <li>Step 2: Kick from your hips rather than from the knees. Quick, small movements will propel you forward more effectively.</li>
                    <li>Step 3: Keep your ankles loose, and point your toes to reduce drag.</li>
                    <li>Step 4: Gradually increase your kick frequency while maintaining control and consistency.</li>
                </ul>
                <iframe class="video" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/u7bSSndOBxU?si=RkEGAqrpdjKeKw-J" title="YouTube video player"

                referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                <h3> Breathing Techniques (Bilateral Breathing)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Step 1: Practice breathing to both sides (bilateral) for balance. Alternate between turning your head left and right to breathe.</li>
                    <li>Step 2: Inhale quickly through your mouth when you turn your head, and exhale underwater as you return your face to the water.</li>
                    <li>Step 3: Use a rhythmic breathing pattern like “2 strokes – breathe – 2 strokes – breathe.”</li>
                    <li>Step 4: Focus on keeping your stroke consistent while practicing this balanced breathing.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Advanced Stroke Techniques (Butterfly and Breaststroke)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Step 1: For the butterfly, start with both arms moving simultaneously, pulling in a “keyhole” pattern in the water.</li>
                    <li>Step 2: Keep your body undulating with the arm strokes, using your core to generate power.</li>
                    <li>Step 3: For breaststroke, keep your arms in a circular motion, bringing them in front of you and pushing outward like a frog kick.</li>
                    <li>Step 4: Focus on timing the arm strokes and leg kicks together for smooth, efficient movement.</li> 
                </ul>
                <iframe class="video" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EElzlIMjk_c?si=4eZKOYOkTq5QcDsh" title="YouTube video player"

                <h3>Flip Turns</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Step 1: As you approach the wall, start your last stroke and then tuck your body into a ball, bringing your knees to your chest.</li>
                    <li>Step 2: Rotate your body quickly into a somersault, keeping your head tucked.</li>
                    <li>Step 3: Push off the wall with your feet, using a streamlined position to minimize drag.</li>
                    <li>Step 4: Begin your next stroke immediately as you leave the wall.</li> 
                </ul>
                <iframe class="video" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Se1j7U8EI2o?si=_aaVsj5YGSW_dOoC" title="YouTube video player"

                referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                <h3>Endurance Training</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Step 1: Start by swimming longer distances at a moderate pace.</li>
                    <li>Step 2: Focus on maintaining consistent breathing patterns, and gradually increase your lap count each session.</li>
                    <li>Step 3: Introduce interval training – alternate between high-intensity sprints and recovery swims.</li>
                    <li>Step 4: Incorporate different strokes to build overall endurance.</li> 
                </ul>
